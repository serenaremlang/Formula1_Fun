ETL project. Taking in Formula 1 data...


## Data:
- https://www.kaggle.com/sveneschlbeck/formula-1-ergast-developer-api-data
  - Contains information about: Drivers, races,
- Wikepedia

## Hypothesis:
We are interested in uncovering:
1) the frequency of which any circuit appeared in the history of formula 1. We also want to uncover which circuit has been featured the most across 1950 to 2021 formula 1 seasons.
2) Who is the most winningest driver in F1 history? How many wins did they have followed by which other driver was closest to them?
3) Is there a significant correlation between which drivers win in the qualifying rounds and those who win the actual race
4) Find all races which have status 121 Megatron and find out what that is by scraping Wikepida post and adding a status description to the status table
