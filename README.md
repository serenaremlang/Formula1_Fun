# Formula1_Fun
ETL project. Taking in Formula 1 data...


## Data:
- https://www.kaggle.com/sveneschlbeck/formula-1-ergast-developer-api-data
  - Contains information about: Drivers, races,
- Wikepedia (to be scraped and formatted with beautifulsoup)

## Hypothesis:
We are interested in uncovering:
1) the frequency of which any circuit appeared in the history of formula 1. We also want to uncover which circuit has been featured the most across 1950 to 2021 formula 1 seasons.
2) who is the most winningest driver in F1 history? How many wins did they have followed by which other driver was closest to them?
3) whether there is there a significant correlation between which drivers win in the qualifying rounds and those who win the actual race?
4) which races resulted in a status Megatron and find out what that is by scraping the Wikepida post and adding a status description to the status table
